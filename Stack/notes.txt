* A Stack is a linear abstract data structure.
* Last In First Out
* The stack data structure can be of two types:
    1. Static stack is implemented using an array in C
    2. Dynamic stack is implemented using a linked list in C.
* Push and Pop are the two primary operations
    Others being Peek, isEmpty, isFull, print
* Applications :
    * infix to postfix, infix to prefix, postfix to infix, and prefix to infix.
    * Recursion: Call Stack
    * Memory Management: Stack allocation
    * Compilation: Syntax Parsing
* The time complexity of all the operations of a Stack is O(1).
